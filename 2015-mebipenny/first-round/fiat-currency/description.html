<h1>Fiat Currency</h1>
<p>In the Bitcoin economy, the blockchain keeps a ledger of every transaction that
has ever been made, since the beginning of time. As you can imagine, this ledger
has gotten really big, over 41 GB as of September 2015. Miners allow for new
transactions to be recored, by adding the new transaction onto the end of the
current blockchain, and repeatedly calculating the SHA256 hash along with
different nonce values until they find a hash that has enough leading 0 bytes to
meet the current rules. More about the hashing algorithm can be read at <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm" class="uri">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm</a></p>

<p>But we don't care about any of that, we're just here to make tons of money. The
first line of input is our starting cash. Each subsequent line of input contains
the current bitcoin price, and an action -- &quot;buy&quot;, &quot;sell&quot;, or &quot;hold&quot; (do
nothing). Each buy or sell is of one bitcoin. Process all the input, and then
output how much cash we have at the end.</p>

<p>For instance, &quot;97 buy&quot; means we spend 97 cash to purchase one bitcoin. &quot;103
sell&quot; means we then sell one coin, adding 103 to our total cash. All prices are
integers.</p>

<p>You can assume that we won't buy when we don't have enough cash, and we won't
sell more coins than we have.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>STDIN:</p>

<pre><code>225
105 buy
102 hold
101 hold
106 sell
102 buy
107 sell</code></pre>

<p>STDOUT:</p>

<pre><code>231</code></pre>
